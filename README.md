# CoreForge

Welcome to CoreForge, a C library containing essential functions crafted for optimal performance in functional programming paradigms.

## Implemented Functions:

- **Map**: Applies a function to each element of a list. DONE
- **Reduce (Fold)**: Combines list elements using an associative function. DONE
- **Filter**: Returns a list containing elements that satisfy a given condition. DONE
- **Zip**: Combines two lists element-wise. DONE
- **Scan**: Produces a list of intermediate results during the application of a cumulative function. DONE
- **ForEach**: Applies a function to each element without returning a result. DONE
- **Any**: Checks if at least one element satisfies a condition.DONE
- **All**: Checks if all elements satisfy a condition. DONE
- **Partition**: Divides a list based on a specified condition.
- **Sort**: Sorts a list according to a specified criterion. DONE
- **GroupBy**: Groups list elements according to a key.
- **Distinct**: Returns a list without duplicates.
- **Take**: Returns the first elements of a list.
- **Drop**: Returns a list without the first elements.
- **Concat**: Concatenates multiple lists.
- **ZipWithIndex**: Associates each element with its index.
- **Repeat**: Creates a list by repeating an element a certain number of times.
- **Generate**: Generates a list by applying a function to each index.
- **Chunk**: Divides a list into chunks of a fixed size.
- **Automatic Parallelization**: Function for automatically parallelizing execution using multiple cores.
